# Inventory Management System - Microservices Architecture

## Overview
This project is an Inventory Management System built using the Microservice Architecture pattern with Spring Boot. The system is designed to manage the stock levels, track inventory transactions, and handle product details across multiple services. It ensures scalability, flexibility, and efficient management of inventory processes.

## Features
- **Microservice Architecture**: Independent services for product management, transaction processing, inventory control, and more.
- **Spring Boot**: Java-based framework for creating microservices.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for product and transaction data.
- **REST APIs**: Expose endpoints for interacting with the system's services.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure access to the APIs using JWT.
- **Elasticsearch**: For fast searching and indexing of products.

## Microservices Overview
1. **Product Service**: Handles product details such as creation, update, and deletion.
2. **Inventory Service**: Manages stock levels and inventory details.
3. **Transaction Service**: Logs and tracks transactions related to inventory changes.
4. **Search Service**: Uses Elasticsearch to quickly search for products and related data.

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot** (Java)
- **Spring Cloud** (for microservices management)
- **MongoDB** (for data storage)
- **Kibana** (for visualization)
- **Elasticsearch** (for search functionality)
- **LogStash** (for Log Monitoring)
- **Spring Security & JWT** (for authentication)
